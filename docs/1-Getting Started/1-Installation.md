## Introduction
There are two ways to install the user package.  First is with the JumpGate installer.  By default, the installer creates
a full suite of JumpGate packages, which includes users.  If you are starting from a fresh Laravel install or you used 
the installer with the `--slim` option then you will need to use the following steps to get users working.
